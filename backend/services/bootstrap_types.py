"""
Bootstrap constants — kernel-known-at-init slugs, content types, and list fixtures.

OS analogy: These are the filesystem formats and mount points the kernel must
understand to boot.  The kernel knows these constants at init time so it can
create the initial platform collections and singleton artifacts during startup.

No other Core code should reference content type strings or slug strings directly —
all runtime type resolution flows through the type registry (types_service) and
the ID registry (platform_topology).

Consumed exclusively by seed/bootstrap services:
  - authority_content_service.py
  - host_content_service.py
  - resources_content_service.py
  - inbox_seeds_content_service.py
  - seed_content_service.py
  - llm_connections_content_service.py

Do NOT add new entries here unless the constant is required for platform bootstrap.
Content types that are not created at startup belong to their owning MCP server.
