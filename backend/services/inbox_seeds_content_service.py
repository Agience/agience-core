# Welcome to Agience

Agience is a human-in-the-loop knowledge curation platform -- built like an OS for AI-powered work.

Think of it as a personal knowledge environment where **humans curate** and **agents assist**.

## The Core Idea

Information in Agience lives as **Artifacts** -- addressable, versioned, committable units of knowledge.
You interact with them as **Cards** in your workspace.

There are two surfaces:

- **Workspaces** -- Draft staging areas. Create, edit, and organise cards before committing.
- **Collections** -- Committed, versioned knowledge. Once you commit artifacts to a collection they're
  part of your permanent knowledge graph.

## How It Fits Together

```
Workspace (draft)  ->  Commit  ->  Collection (permanent)
     ↓                                  ↓
  Cards (UI)                       Artifacts (agents)
```

Agents see **Artifacts**. You see **Cards**. Same content, different surfaces.

## What's in Your Inbox

Your **Inbox** workspace is pre-populated with onboarding cards -- including this one.
Browse the other cards here to learn the basics before you start creating your own.

You can also explore the **Start Here** and **Platform Artifacts** collections in the left sidebar.

## Next Steps

1. Browse the other cards here to learn the basics.
2. Open a workspace and start creating cards.
3. Commit your work to a collection when you're ready.
4. Use search (⌘K / Ctrl+K) to find anything across all your knowledge.

# Working with Cards

Cards are the primary way you interact with information in Agience. Every card represents an
**Artifact** -- a unit of knowledge with content and context.

## Card States

Every card has a state that tells you what's happening with it:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Draft** | Work in progress, not yet committed to any collection |
| **Committed** | Committed to a collection -- versioned and searchable |
| **Archived** | No longer active, but preserved in history |

## Creating Cards

Click the **+** button in any workspace to create a new card. You can also:

- Drag and drop files to create cards from documents, audio, video, or images
- Use an agent to generate and create cards for you via chat

## Editing Cards

Click any card to open it. Edit the content directly -- changes are saved automatically to the workspace.

## Card Actions

When you hover over a card you'll see action buttons:

- **Delete** (draft cards) -- remove from workspace entirely
- **Commit** -- commit this card to a collection
- **Revert** -- undo changes since last commit
- **Archive** -- archive the card

## Content Types

Cards can hold many types of content: plain text, markdown, PDFs, images, audio, video, and
custom structured types for things like agents, servers, and transforms. The card viewer
automatically renders the correct format.

        "content": """\
# Collections and Commits

Collections are your permanent knowledge store. When you commit a workspace artifact to a
collection it becomes **versioned, searchable, and shareable**.

## What Is a Collection?

A collection is a named, versioned set of committed artifacts -- like a repository or knowledge base
that holds the curated, trusted version of your work.

Collections have:

- A **name** and optional **description**
- An **owner** (you, or the platform)
- **Version history** -- every commit is recorded
- **Access control** -- share with others (read-only or read-write)

## The Commit Flow

1. **Draft** your cards in a workspace
2. **Review** your changes
3. **Commit** -- select cards and commit them to a collection

Once committed, that version of an artifact is locked. Future edits create a new version.

## Browsing Collections

Use the left sidebar to find collections:

- **My Collections** -- collections you own or have write access to
- **Shared With Me** -- collections others have granted you access to
- **Platform** -- system-managed collections (like this one)

## Search

Use the search bar (⌘K / Ctrl+K) to search across **all** your collections and workspaces at once.
Agience uses hybrid search (semantic + keyword) so natural-language queries work well.

## Sharing

From a collection's settings you can generate a share link with read (or read-write) access.
Shares use time-limited tokens backed by the grant system.

        "content": """\
# AI Agents and MCP

Agience is built around **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** -- an open standard for connecting AI
models to tools and resources. Every agent in Agience is an MCP server.

## Platform Agents

Your instance includes eight built-in server personas:

| Agent | Specialty |
|-------|-----------|
| **Aria** | Output & presentation -- formats results for humans |
| **Astra** | Ingestion & indexing -- captures and prepares content |
| **Atlas** | Governance & coherence -- tracks provenance and contracts |
| **Sage** | Research & retrieval -- searches and synthesises knowledge |
| **Nexus** | Networking & routing -- connects services and channels |
| **Ophan** | Finance & licensing -- value transfers and entitlements |
| **Seraph** | Security & trust -- access control and cryptographic signing |
| **Verso** | Reasoning & workflows -- orchestrates multi-step tasks |

Browse **Platform Artifacts -> All Servers** for details on each server, and
**Platform Artifacts -> All Tools** for a complete tool catalog.

## Using Agents

You can invoke agents in three ways:

1. **Via Chat** -- type in the chat panel; Aria handles conversation and delegates to other agents
2. **Via the Command Palette** (⌘K) -- search for an agent action and run it directly
3. **Via Transforms** -- create an artifact with a `run` block that chains agent actions

## Adding External Servers

You can connect any MCP-compatible server to Agience by creating a card of type
`vnd.agience.mcp-server+json` in your workspace. Once registered, its tools become
available to agents.

## The MCP Advantage

Because agents communicate via MCP they're:

- **Composable** -- tools from different servers chain together
- **Discoverable** -- the platform can list all available tools at runtime
- **Secure** -- auth tokens are scoped per server and per workspace
